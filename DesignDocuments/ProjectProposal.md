`Intial Ideas`:

`Adoption Center Main Model`

Dogs as objects with name, breed, age, sex as main fields. Hypoallergenic will be a boolean field that is dependent on breed.

Collection will be a list of Dog objects up for adoption.

https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2
We will use this API to get a list of breeds and their details to assign to our dog objects

It will need addDog, removeDog, changeDogAge, methods.
Add setPrice method()

Ready for adoption field, in order to be true, needs to have a price field set.
Image field tied to dog object that is the dogâ€™s picture/optional field.

Main Model Responsibilities:

Philip - API integration and Dog object mapping

Joel -  API integration and Dog object mapping

Dina -  Altering the list to include these methods addDog, removeDog, changeDogAge methods.

Emily - Altering the list to include these methods addDog, removeDog, changeDogAge methods. 

`Adoption Center Controller`:

Parses user input:

Filters and returns inputted field to match what user wants to search whether its breed, age greaterthan/lessthan/equal, sex, hypoallergenic true/false
Sort by breed in alphabetical order or by age or by sex, maybe even name in alphabetical order

Search can search for name, age, breed, male and applies those filters
Only returns dogs ready for adoption

Controller Responsibilities:

Joel & Philip - MainController that reads user input

Dina & Emily - FilterPlanner that filters information from a filter command

`Adoption Center View`:

Website

Home page displays all the fields that can be filtered by. Maybe have the most populated breeds be displayed

Then have a search bar that can take arguments such as Breed: Terrier, Age: >3 that will return a list that links to the pages for all the dogs that match the criteria and those pages will have all the details of the dog, a larger picture, the age, the name, etc.

Everyone will work together on all features.
