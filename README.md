* D.E.J.P's Adoption Center Program: A program that allows the user to view a collection of adoptable dogs from our shelter. The user will be able to filter and sort through the dogs based off of certain dog details and then be able to add whichever dog they want to a wishlist. The user will also be able to save their wishlist to a JSON file.
